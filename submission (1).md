## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - john_results)/john_results)`.
