# WedgeProject
The Wedge Project involves creating a data pipeline to analyze data from the Wedge Coop Grocery stores. Inside this project you will find 3 main Tasks:

## Task 1: Data Cleaning and Upload
1. Data Cleaning and Upload : The goal of this task is fairly self explanatory. The data is cleaned and uploaded to a GBQ database. Within Task 1 itself I will go over my methods of cleaning and uploading the data. 

## Task 2: Sampling of Uploaded Data
2. Sampling of Uploaded Data : The goal of this task is to sample owners from the uploaded data, sampling gives us a smaller subset of the data to work with. This is useful when working with large datasets.

## Task 3: Querying Uploaded Data to Answer Questions and Provide Insights
3. Querying Uploaded Data to Answer Questions and Provide Insights : The goal of this task is to query the uploaded data to answer questions and provide insights. Similar to task 2, this can provide us with a smaller subset of the data to work with.
